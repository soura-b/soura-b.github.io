# Short story

I have posted bits and pieces of my attempts to write a yet-untitled short story. Some of the chapters are situation sketches, some are attempts are building characters. Some are plain whimsy.

You WILL find inconsistencies. _Caveat emptor!_

"[The boy who went up the hill](03.-the-boy-who-went-up-the-hill.md)" can be read as a standalone piece.
