# 02. The jungle lodge

"Kavi! Kaaaviiii!" Anita's stentorian voice cut through the chatter of the nighttime jungle. After a trying a few more times, she sighed and leaned back on her bed.

_This boy will send me to an early grave_, she thought, _but he'll come by to put flowers every day._

They had reached the jungle lodge in the afternoon. A lovely evening stroll with Madhav was followed by an early dinner, for which Kavi had to dragged away from his book. Now it was time for his salt water gargle, but the boy was nowhere to be seen.

Fortunately, the jungle retreat was ringed with electric fences than got turned on after sundown. Kavi was safe within its boundaries. Well, safe from wild animals, but not safe from tripping over roots or walking into trees.

_My dreamer_, she thought.

Kavi loved reading, and he loved weaving stories based on what he read. He saw flying people, birds that wore monocles, and planes that turned into boats. His imagination did not discriminate. Science fiction, magic, and nature—they all existed in equal measure in the worlds he created. Then again, discrimination—and divisiveness—was an adult skill.

Anita put on her glasses, opened a magazine, and settled down to wait for Kavi's return.
