# About me
My name is Soura, and I have been around for a bit over four decades.

I have a B.Tech (Hons) in Chemical Engineering from IIT Kharagpur, and a MBA (High Honors) from Harvard Business School. 

After my undergraduate studies, I started my career in 2001 with ITC Limited, one of India’s largest conglomerates. There, I worked in engineering and factory operations.

After my MBA, I switched to medical devices — and have stayed in healthcare industry ever since. I worked for OmniGuide, a startup that came out of MIT. It was a treat to see the US startup ecosystem from the inside.

After five years with OmniGuide, I returned to India, and joined a rural hospital chain, Glocal. There, I had the opportunity to play a myriad of leadership roles — spanning healthcare IT, medical devices, hospital operations, supply chain, process improvement, and human resources.

Since 2014, I have been running [Lattice Innovations](https://www.thelattice.in), a solution design firm with a focus on monitoring and measurement systems — such as apps for primary care, networked ICUs, and disease screening & surveillance programs. Lattice has worked with Fortune 50 firms, the World Health Organization, and State and Central Governments in India and overseas.

I hope you enjoy some of what I have written.
