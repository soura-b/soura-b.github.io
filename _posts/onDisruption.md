title:  "On Disruption"
---

Isaac Asimov and Clayton Christensen are two of my favorite authors, though they write about subjects as different as Trantor and Terminus. What brings them together is the concept of disruptive change.

In Asimov’s epic Foundation and the Empire saga, Trantor is the dying home of the Empire. 

Spoiler alert. Stop here if you haven’t read the Foundation Series, take a week off from work, and go get the books. You can thank me later.

So, in Asimov’s epic Foundation and the Empire saga, Trantor is the dying home of the Empire. Through the course of the saga, Trantor loses its galactic primacy to Terminus. Galactic primacy — not some measly interplanetary race.

What distinguishes Terminus from Trantor is its lack of physical resources, metals in particular. This limitation forces the Foundation out of Terminus to innovate &mdash; and develop systems, technologies and weapons that could work with limited resources. Trantor has planet level shields; Terminus develops portable, one-man shields. 

This is classic disruptive innovation - where a new set of consumers who do not participate in the existing market (who Clay dubs ‘non-consumers’) adopt something new, something wildly divergent from the inaccesible status quo.
