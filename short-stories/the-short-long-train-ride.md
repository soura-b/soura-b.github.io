# The short, long train ride

Kavi glanced at the book in his lap. He was bored. It was not because of the book. It was because he was unable to read the book.

"...when I was your age, that was when the second Indo-China war started. At that time, my cousin had just opened a shop..." The fourth passenger in their train coupe continued a story that had started two stations ago. Stations on this train line were about forty-five minutes apart.

Kavi felt his eyes glaze over. His looked right through Indo-China uncle's black spectacles, and then zoomed back out to regard a pinched face with a sparse moustache. On the left cheek, a mole twitched. A single hair emerged from it, waving in sync with uncle's moving lips.

_Maybe that hair is an antenna that catches radio waves_, Kavi thought. And those radio waves became thought waves, which then became an unending stream of words, pouring all over him and his parents.

He glanced at Ma and Baba.

Ma had her serious face on. It was the same face that she put on when Kavita aunty spoke to her. She sat facing their co-passenger, and nodding along to the beat of the story. But her tightly clenched hands gave her away.

Baba was hunched over, half hidden in the sharp shadow cast by the single night light. His posture was sleepy, his eyes were not. They danced across the other three occupants of their cubicle, before alighting on Kavi. When their eyes met, Kavi saw a spark of mischief.

That spark grew, and pulled up a corner of Baba's lips.

"Three days ago, I dropped an egg on the floor, but it didn't crack," he said. He turned towards the co-passenger. "Why do you think that was, Mr. Shastri?"

Ma's eyes widened. Shastri uncle took a beat to realize that he had lost his audience. "Umm..", he floundered, "Was it hard boiled?"

"Good guess! No. And I dropped it on a hard floor. Try again!" said Baba.

Shastri uncle's brow furrowed. His face became even more pinched. Finally, he threw up his arms in surrender.

"Well, it was luck!" said Baba, with an innocent smile. It was met with an uncertain look from Shastri uncle.

"I have a follow-up question!" Baba continued. From the corner of his eye, Kavi saw Ma shift in her seat. She seemed to be seeking out the same shadow that Baba has been lounging in. Her hands were no longer clenched, though.

"Two days ago, I dropped the same egg on the floor. Again, it did not crack. Why?"

"Luck!" roared Shastri uncle, "Ha ha! You won't get me that eas..."

"No, it was experience," said Baba.

Before Shastri uncle could recover, Baba continued. "I have a third and final question."

"Go on," said Shastri uncle through gritted teeth. Ma had pulled her blue shawl over herself. It made her blend in with the vinyl upholstery. Kavi leaned forward, eyes darting from Baba's face to Shastri uncle's.

"Yesterday, I dropped that damnable egg a third time. This time..." Baba paused. "This time, it _cracked_!"

Shastri uncle lips disappeared in a thin line. He fought a losing battle to stay silent. "Bad luck!" he said.

Baba leaned back. His smile had turned beatific. "No. It was overconfidence."
