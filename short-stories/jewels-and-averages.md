# Jewels and averages

It was late morning. Kavi stood still, mesmerized by the roaring river. The events of last night had faded, misty and dark now, even more insubstantial than a dream. _Or maybe I am dreaming now_, thought Kavi. The river's sounds filled his head, and its sparkles filled his eyes. If he could, he would scoop up some of the gleaming bits and take it back home to Delhi.

He had tried to do just that, six years ago, _When I was just a kid_. That had been his first visit to Marchula. But all the jewels of the water had disappeared, leaving behind a plain, unmoving puddle that slowly trickled out of his cupped hands. He had burst into tears when that had happened, and Baba had gathered him in his arms, and said, "I wish Snell could see the havoc he has wrought".

He had gone on to talk about reflection and refractive index and light and water and how human eyes worked and what fishes saw and what birds saw and on and on, his soft words meshing with the gurgle of the river, words that had cooled down Kavi's agitation like a soothing dollop of ice cream on a hot summer day.

_Ice cream doesn't have ice_, thought Kavi. _Does it have cream? I have to ask Baba!_ He jumped to his feet and ran towards the cottages.

Baba was, quite unsurprisingly, lounging on a easy chair, reading.

"Does ice cream have cream?"

Baba peered over the top of the book. "Like the body cream you apply after you take a bath?"

"But that tastes awful! Ice cream tastes so good", said Kavi. "What are you reading?"

"It's a book about mathematicians who lived hundreds, even thousands of years ago."

"They had maths thousands of years ago?"

"We have always had mathematics. We just came to understand it better over the years," said Baba. "Tell me, how would you work out the distance from home to school if you couldn't use a map?"

Kavi pondered the question. "I would look at the kilometer indictor in front of the bus driver!"

"That's a good idea. What if you didn't have a bus?"

"I would count my steps."

"Are your steps uniform?"

Kavi knew for a fact that they were not. It took him many more steps to reach the shower in winter than in summer.

Baba smiled at Kavi's frown. "But what if you counted your steps every day, for a week, then averaged it? Would that be more accurate?"

"That makes sense," Kavi said. "Is all this in your book?"

"There's a chapter about it. Averages were invented by merchants, almost 3,000 years ago. Their shipments would be lost at sea, and they needed a way to divide losses equally among themselves."
