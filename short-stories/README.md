# Short stories

As I attempt to write a short story that's about fifty pages in length, I will post bits and pieces. Some of them are situation sketches, some are attempts are building characters. Some are plain whimsy.

"[The boy who went up the hill](the-boy-who-went-up-the-hill.md)" can be read as a standalone piece.

If you read them in the sequence they are posted, then you will see skips, jumps, and inconsistencies. _Caveat emptor!_
