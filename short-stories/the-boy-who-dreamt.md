# The boy who dreamt

Kavi rested his head again the tree trunk. "Just a few minutes," he thought.

His mad scramble had started with a mad idea — look for a tiger by the river, at night.

Sometimes, Ma would pull his ear, and tell him off about his harebrained schemes. At other times, after executing aforesaid harebrained scheme, he would tell _himself_ off. Tonight was a special case of the latter. He closed his eyes and let his mind wander.

Kavi and his parents had come for a weekend to a jungle lodge in the Marchula valley. On the train ride over from Delhi to Kathgodam, his nose was almost constantly buried in a book. It was Jim Corbett's "Man-eaters of Kumaon".

As the train clattered along, Kavi imagined himself walking softly through forests and glade, tracking bird calls and pug marks in search of an elusive tiger. On and off, he would gaze out into the night, and words from the page would twist into lines of red, white, and yellow, forming fearsome beasts and brave hunters, before dissipating into darkness.

Ma called him "my dreamer", her affection often tinged with exasperation. Kavi didn't mind. He loved reading, and he loved creating more stories based on what he read. He saw flying people, birds that wore monocles, and planes that turned into boats. His imagination did not discriminate. Science fiction, magic, and nature — they all existing in equal measure in the worlds he created. Then again, discrimination — and divisiveness — was an adult skill.

His father was more sanguine. "He will grow out of it," Kavi heard Baba say to Ma, the night before their trip.

"Last night, he flew a plane through the flower pot in the guest room window," came the reply, "I expect a 13-year old to be more sensible."

"A plane?"

"It was imaginary. The pot wasn't."

"How does an imaginary plane...?" Baba's question petered off when he looked at Ma.

Kavi couldn't see her from where he was nestled with a book, but he could well imagine the look on her face. The same look made him do his homework promptly. "It works on Baba too," he thought, filing that observation away because it felt vaguely important.

Kavi awoke with a start. His ill-advised adventures must have tired him out more than he imagined. Had the moon moved higher into the night sky? How long had he been asleep?

A sharp breeze sprang up, sending chills down his spine. Kavi realized he was wearing just a long-sleeved cotton shirt — in a act of defiance, he had left behind his thick sweater that Ma made him wear whenever _she_ was feeling cold. It also got caught in brambles and branches, and Mr. Corbett himself had written that while in the wilds, one had to be quiet and stealthy. The final nail — it was electric blue. Not exactly subtle.

_Maybe I will wear it if I go exploring in a submarine_, Kavi thought, _with Captain Nemo! We will see sharks, and blue whales, and giant squid!_

Another gust of wind cut short his musings. He pulled the shawl tighter. It seemed heavier now, blocking the wind from neck to knee. His face was still unprotected. As soon as he realized this, a torn edge of the blanket fluttered onto his face. Tucking it into his cap, he stood up on shaky feet.

Time to walk back. The night wasn't over.
