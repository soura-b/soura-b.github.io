title: "On Disruption"
---

Isaac Asimov and Clayton Christensen are two of my favorite authors, though they write about subjects as different as Trantor and Terminus. What brings them together is the concept of disruptive change.

In Asimov’s epic _Foundation_ series, Trantor is the dying home of the Empire. 

Spoiler alert. Stop here if you haven’t read the Foundation series, take a week off from work, and go get the books. You can thank me later.

So, through the course of the saga, Trantor loses its galactic primacy to Terminus, the seat of the Foundation. I always wanted to use the phrase "galactic primacy" in a blog post.

The Foundation starts small — a hardscrabble group isolated in the deep dark, on a planet with limited physical resources, especially metals. This forces them to innovate and develop systems, technologies and weapons that work within their limitations. Trantor has fixed city-sized shields; Terminus develops portable shields for individual use.

This is classic disruptive innovation — in which an entirely new market segment is served by a new technology. In the case of shields, individuals are the market segment. The new technology may be much more limited than the status quo, but wins on dimensions such as affordability and portability. The status quo may serve a few high-end market segments very well, but is grossly over-engineered for what the new market segment needs. According to Christensen, this new segment consists of those who were "non-consumers".

Even the governance systems in the Foundation differ widely from the Empire. The latter is centralized — a core contributor to its eventual downfall. Conversely, decentralization prevails in the Foundation. They need local autonomy to run a system too complex to centralize. Governance standards developed that allow different planets to interact. This too, is an aspect of the theory of disruptive change formulated by Christensen. New technologies develop new models of interoperability. 

Every scientific discovery is not disruptive. A better adhesive, a faster chip — these are sustaining innovations that, even if they represent breakthrough science, extend the trajectory of existing technologies. They do not reach out to non-consumers. 

Disruption is systemic change — when a new set of actors find new ways to deliver products & services to non-consumers. In doing so, they create the potential for fundamental shifts — both technological and societal. And Asimov explores these societal changes beautifully.
