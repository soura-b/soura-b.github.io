After parking, just follow the crowd! If there are no crowds, you got the day wrong.

## üçõ Bhog timings

* Generally starts at 1:00 pm, ends at 4:00 pm. Everyone promises it will start at 12:30 pm, but I have yet to see it happen.
* If you want to eat in the first batch, arrive by 12:15 pm.
* Otherwise good to reach at around 2:30 pm, by which time the initial rush has reduced.
* Buffet and seated service both available. Wait time to be seated: 20-30 minutes
