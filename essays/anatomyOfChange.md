title: "The Anatomy of Change"
---

Change is often described as a continuous process. My experience suggests otherwise. I think of change as impulse &mdash; force applied over a very brief interval of time. Effective change is instaneous &mdash; as long as it has sufficient force of skill, will and effort behind it.

What is commonly meant by change, is, in fact, three discrete steps — preparing for change, making the change, and sustaining it. Think of it as pushing a car that refuses to start[^1]. You take a few deep breaths, anchor your feet, and place your hands on a part of the car that won't break off. This is preparation. Then the actual push &mdash; maximum effort! — to get the stationary object in motion. Finally, once the car starts rolling, you keep pushing, to sustain the change. The effort now is lower, but it has to be consistent.

If these three steps are covered in the catch-all phrase, "change management", we risk getting something wrong. Each step is unique, and needs to addressed differently.

## Preparing for change
Preparation for change starts with realizing the need for change. In organizations, this is often precipitated by a crisis &mdash; either external or internal. Competent, forward-looking leaders bring about change by either creating an internal crisis, or harnessing an external one to suit their goals. As the adage goes, "never waste a good crisis". 

Once the need is felt, organizations have to agree on what and how to change. This is alignment. An aligned organization can push in the same direction. Conversely, a misaligned organization expends tremendous effort without commensurate gain &mdash; leading to fatigue and disillusionment. 

## Making the change
The essence of change is aligned action. Aligned &mdash; because my toes cannot point away from my hands when I push the car. Action &mdash; because this is not the time to speculate about why the car was not somewhere uphill. I must simply push &mdash; hard enough to overcome static friction.

## Sustaining change
Once the car is in motion, I stop pushing for a second or two, to see how well intertia has taken hold. Sustaining change takes less physical effort. But, what makes it challenging is &mdash; my mind has to remain engaged while my body takes short breaks. Similarly, after making a change, an organization's attention has to remain engaged, while its effort are redistributed. This rebalancing of "head versus hands" requires care &mdash; and merits attention during the planning phase[^2].

I have found that the environment to be of particlar importance for sustaining change. Consider the following example:

You are a hospital administrator who wants to improve the quality of outpatient services. You define quality as correct diagnosis, convenient access to services, and cost-effective treatment.

Since you are an administrator, you first focus on improving access &mdash; it appears well within your span of control. You and your team of receptionists, pharmacists, and lab technicians, decides that reducing wait time is the first target. Now, you are aligned.

You conduct a workshop, come up with executable ideas, and implement them. For instance, you improve communication between the doctor's office and the pharmacy in order to reduce wait times at the pharmacy counter. The very next day, patients comment on the improvement. The team celebrates.

However, the rest of the staff, whether due to overloading or poorly-defined processes, are frequently late in completing their patient care activities. How long do you think the change will last after the initial enthusiasm wanes?

Hence, to sustain change, the environment has to enable it. This is the job of leaders in the organization &mdash; to create an environment that promotes changes to a more elevated state.

In summary, the better we understand the three steps of change &mdash; preparation (need, alignment), change (synchronous action), sustenance (discipline, enabling environment) &mdash; the more equipped we become to change to a more elevated state[^3].

### Footnotes
[^1]: I first thought of using the well-trodden analogy of pushing a boulder uphill. Then I realized that I am no Sisyphus; I have not even _seen_ a boulder being pushed uphill. What I have done many times, is push the family car &mdash; the venerable Maruti 800. I think it was my father's way of checking my cardiovascular capacity. 
[^2]: This rebalancing can be achieved if we update our work standards to incorporate the change.
[^3]: Each cycle change improves our capability to plan and execute the next one. In the world of car-pushing, my father and I got the process down to a science. We knew the highest point of the lane in front of our flat &mdash; the starting point. I knew the exact spot where he would stop pushing and jump in, and I would have to compensate. And I learned to use my legs and back. That last lesson still stands me in good stead.
