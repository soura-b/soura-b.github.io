title: "The Magic of Sant Kabir"
---

It was middle school that introduced me to Sant Kabir’s _dohas_, or couplets. But only in recent years’ have I begun appreciating them — for their startling combination of profound wisdom and simple expression.

One of the _dohas_ that has stayed in my memory is:

ऐसी वाणी बोलिए, मन का आप खोए,  
औरन को शीतल करे, आपहुं शीतल होए

_Aisi vaani boliye, mann ka aapa khoye,  
Auron ko sheetal kare, aaphun sheetal hoye._

"_Aapa_" can be roughly translated as "feeling of self", or "ego-sense". So, when we speak without an ego-sense in our minds, then not only do our words sound sweet and calming to others, they also bring us peace. This leads me to the following free translation:

_Such should be your speech, it pays your ego no mind.  
The listener is at peace, and peace is what you’ll find._

What exactly is this ego that Sant Kabir asks us to discard? The definition offered by Vedanta appeals to me. It defines the mind through its four functions — _mana_, _buddhi_, _chitta_, _ahankara_:
1. _mana_: the considering part of the mind — “Which route should I take to work?”
2. _buddhi_: the determinative faculty that answers the questions raised by the mana — “The route past the metro station is the quickest way to work.”
3. _chitta_: the memory — “This is the turn I should take.”
4. _ahankara_: the ego, which adds the I, me and mine — “this is _my_ route to work; there is _my_ office,  _I_ will take a cab today.”.

Ego has also been described as "that which appropriates to itself, what is not its own". For instance, when a car hits the one I am in, my reaction is, "You hit me!". My sense of ego is so strong that it expanded to include a 1,500 kg piece of metal.

Vedanta takes us in the opposite direction. It demonstrates how “I” am neither the body, nor the mind, let alone a motor vehicle.

And through his _doha_, I believe Sant Kabir wanted to make this philosophy accessible, with a simple, everyday test — examine your speech to examine your attitude, and modify your speech to modify your attitude.
