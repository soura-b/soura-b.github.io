title: "Building product"

_This post is inspired by advice to a fellow entrepreneur. Now all I need to do is follow it myself._

One thing that many founders — myself included — get wrong while building a product is not narrowing their focus enough. This is counterintuitive — we are supposed to think about scale! I look at a Facebook and marvel at billions of users, forgetting that seeds of success were laid while targeting a few thousand. 

You have a natural advantage here. You have rich data about 500 enterprises. What one or two (not even three!) problems do they have, that you feel compelled to solve? And are those problems among the enterprises' top five?

For example, I get a ton of unsoliciated emails from recruitment agencies. But I run a firm that hires < 5 employees a year. A larger recruitment pipeline is important for me, but not critical. Ergo, I am a poor target. They would be better served by targeting firms that hire every month — driven by higher growth or higher turnover[^1].

So, which 50 (or 10) of your 500 enterprises share a common, burning need that you can build for? Something that virtually ensures that they will use what you have built every day? Something as useful to them as the alarm clock app is to me?

And before you build anything, how much can you fake-build? Here is a self-gratifying example. 

In the early days of Lattice, someone asked if we could build them a "auto-pharmacy". The conversation went something like this.

"Can you build us a drug dispensing unit? Something we can place in a high traffic locations like metro stations."

"Yes, sure! It will take 4 days. How soon can you get a clearance from the Delhi Metro authorities?"

"4 days!?"

"4 days."

"But how?"

"I'll make a box and stand inside it. When someone pushes a button, and inserts currency, I will dispense."

The conversation quickly wrapped up after that.

And for doing all this, you do not need to know a single line of code. You need to live and breathe your users.
