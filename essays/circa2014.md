to me

1. Take no pride in teaching others.
2. Hunt to feed the families of all those who depend on you.
4. Know your purpose, then be the best the best instrument you can be to fulfill that purpose.
5. Discretion and transparency go hand in hand.
6. It is foolish to have expectations from the past.
7. Say the truth but say it without bitterness. Bitterness comes out before sweetness.
8. Empathy allows the truth to be sweet.
9. Pride is my greatest enemy, because it hides itself so beautifully. Often, it takes the guise of humility.
10. Adopt the Marwari accounting method. Set a daily cash collection target, 20 days in a month. Anything less is a loss. 2 days of rest a week is required to fulfill the target. One day for self, and one for family.
11. Those with the most expectations of you carry the greatest burden of all: that of expectations they could not meet.
12. Objects are inanimate. Yet they have power.
13. Acceptance precedes change.
14. Knowledge, realization, acceptance, practice, wisdom, truth.
15. Loyalty is not a virtue.
16. Learn to listen and you will learn to learn. Everyone has something to say, hence everyone is a source of learning.
17. Dharma is unchanging, regardless of your capabilities. (wrote without understanding)
18. Accept, do not resign. He who resigns strays from the path of Karma.
19. You may meander, but you cannot stray. Meander on your day of rest.
20. Replace you with I in the sentences above.
21. Sleep is essential. Opportunities abound. (Samreen and Chayan helped articulate)
22. Be mindful always, except on your day of rest. Then you can meander.
23. Do not resent your teacher for true lessons that you fail to practice.
24. Jiyo aur jeeney do (learnt from Chayan)
25. If you think fast, you have to do faster. This allows time for rest.
26. Trust everyone to be true to their nature.
30. People keep pets to experience unconditional love.
31. Meet a prince as you would meet a pauper.
32. Don't run faster than the world.
